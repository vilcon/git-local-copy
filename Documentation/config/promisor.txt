promisor.quiet::
	If set to "true" assume `--quiet` when fetching additional
	objects for a partial clone.

promisor.advertise::
	If set to "true", a server will use the "promisor-remote"
	capability, see linkgit:gitprotocol-v2[5], to advertise the
	promisor remotes it is using if any. Default is "false", which
	means no promisor remote is advertised.

promisor.acceptFromServer::
	If set to "all", a client will accept all the promisor remotes
	a server might advertise using the "promisor-remote"
	capability, see linkgit:gitprotocol-v2[5]. If set to
	"knownName" the client will accept promisor remotes which are
	already configured on the client and have the same name as
	those advertised by the client. If set to "knownUrl", the
	client will accept promisor remotes which have both the same
	name and the same URL configured on the client as the name and
	URL advertised by the server. Default is "none", which means
	no promisor remote advertised by a server will be accepted.
